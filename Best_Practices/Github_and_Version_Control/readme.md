# Version control and best practices overview

This repository contains documentation for version control best practices using GitHub to support computational workflows in the [Comprehensive Laboratory for Untargeted Exposome Science (CLUES)](https://github.com/clues-lab) at Emory University. It covers Git fundamentals, the use of Claude Code as an AI-assisted development tool, and standardized workflows for collaborative code development in exposomics and metabolomics research.

## Getting Started

If you are new to this repository or to using GitHub with Claude Code, start here:

1. **Set up your environment** — follow the guide for your platform:
   - [Mac Terminal](setup-mac.md)
   - [Windows PowerShell](setup-windows.md)
   - [VS Code](setup-vscode.md) (Mac or Windows)

2. **Read the workflow guide** — [GitHub and Claude Code Lab Manual](github-claude-code-manual.md) covers everything from core Git concepts to naming conventions, the standard workflow for making changes, changelog maintenance, and Git tags for marking milestones.
